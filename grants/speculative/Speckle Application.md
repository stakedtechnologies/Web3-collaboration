# Speckle OS

## Project Description
We are building a universal user interface for Polkadot, Substrate and Web 3. This involves three parts:
1. a browser extension wallet that handles account management and dApp interactivity across Substrate chains;
2. a back-end parachain that handles identity, account management and communication; and
3. the speckle-ui framework for substrate-based chains.

We are currently focusing on the browser extension 'Speckle'. We are coming to the successful end of our first grant and have delivered beyond the scope of our application. We still require a bit more support to complete the core functionality of the product before we can seek commercialisation. One such way that we hope to commercialise Speckle is through fiat-to-crypto on-boarding via the application (e.g. purchasing DOTs, EDG etc through Speckle to interact with the various networks).

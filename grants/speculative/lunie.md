# Lunie + Kusama + Polkadot = üòç

## A brief description of the project.
Lunie is one of the top staking and governance platforms for proof of stake blockchains. We'd like to add support for Kusama and Polkadot to our iOS, Android, and web applications. Support would include integration with the [Ledger Nano app](https://github.com/ZondaX/ledger-polkadot) and our [Lunie browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lunie-browser-extension/hbaijkfbhhdhhjdfbpdafkjimohblhgf) ‚Äî as well as support for key management, portfolio management, and staking. We'd also like to include guides for how these things work inside the Lunie apps.

From the "Areas of Interest" list:
- ‚úÖ Wallets (including Metamask-like wallets)
- ‚úÖ Mobile integration
- ‚úÖ Hardware wallet integration
- ‚úÖ Guides

## An indication of why this project is good for the ecosystem.

Participating in the staking economy can be complex and overwhelming. Lunie can help by providing a modern user experience and easy-to-use products that Kusama / Polkadot users will love. Our mobile apps, web wallet, and browser extension make it extremely simple to send and receive tokens, build a staking portfolio, interact with the network, and monitor performance over time. 

Having support for Kusama and Polkadot in Lunie will make them more accessible, understandable, and more delightful to engage with. Cosmos token holders and validators love Lunie ‚Äî and we think Polka-folks will too. üòá

## An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot.

Lunie is an extensible staking platform. The integration will involve setting up the node infrastructure, writing API mappers for the Lunie API, integrating Polkadot in our test suites, and building UI for key management, and staking into mobile, the Lunie browser extension, and Lunie.io.

- üíª Adding extension support to the Lunie browser extension
- üëã Browser extension support for existing extensions
- üîë Kusama / Polkadot key management and staking on iOS and Android
- üì± Ledger Nano support for web and mobile (Nano X)
- üìö Integrated Guides for key management and staking

## An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

Polkadot is one of the most promising new blockchain platforms. We are passionate about providing world class experiences for staking communities around the world and are confident that a Lunie x Polkadot integation would be extremely well-received and impactful.  We're excited to dive deep into Polka-land and help in any way we can.

## The team's long-term plans and intentions 
Long term, we will continue to support other staking and decentralized communities. After these three milestones we would love to add support for governance, push notifications, accounting tools, and many other key features that will benefit the Polkadot community.

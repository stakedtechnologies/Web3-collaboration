# Project name
BinanceDEX Bridge

## Project Description
This project is all about making a bridge between Binance DEX and Substrate. Listing tokens at a popular exchange is definitely necessary ,but it is expensive and it takes long time. In addition, since all parachains are built not with Ethereum but with Substrate, user accessibility is still not good enough compared with the existing methods to get tokens. (e.g. Uniswap, Bancor, Kyber) We will solve these problems by making a bridge between Binance DEX and SUbstrate. Obiously, Binance is the top crypto exchange and there are many daily active users. If we could make the bridge, all parachain tokens could be traded through Binance DEX. This can bring many users from other blockchain platforms to Polkadot ecosystem.

As you may know, our team is building Plasm Network, a scalable smart contract platform which is compatible with Polkadot. One of the key milestones for us is to list the PLM token at a popular exchange so that it is much more accessible for crypto enthusiasts to interact with Plasm Network. Plasm Network is built with Substrate, so if you can make the bridge between them. This mechanism can be applied to other Substrate based Parachains.

# Enterprise Polkadot API

## Project Description
We propose to add uniformity across Substrate APIs and to utilize well known interfaces called Database Abstraction Layers (DBAL or DAL). 

In addition, in the scope of this proposal are the robust, Enterprise-level Indexer and a Consensus Ensurer, which will greatly improve security and reliability of applications that work with Polkadot.

### Why Enterprise API is Good for the Ecosystem
It will allow any Enterprise-level potential Polkadot user with widely used Frameworks such as Entity or Hibernate to set up a pilot of Polkadot in a few days, rather than weeks or months. They will be able to connect multipe applications quickly and easily. Indexer and Consensus Ensurer will add unique capabilities. Combined, these features will make Polkadot stand out in meeting the needs of Enterprise users.

### How Enterprise API Integrates into Substrate
Details are provided in the linked document

### Why our Team is Interested
After building C++ and C# APIs for Polkadot, we see this addition as an opportunity to provide a solution to a target market that will naturally fit into Polkadot's vision and make it uniquely strong among public blockchains. We will be looking forward to supporting this segment with Integration and other pilot projects.

## Development Roadmap
Project roadmap and financial plan will be shared privately via Google Form.

Long term plans start with developing APIs for all mainstream languages as well as in-depth API improvement. As Polkadot community high level usecases evolve, APIs will adapt.


## Additional Information

### What work has been done so far?
Research, Architecture and Design are completed (see Development Roadmap). We started working on the static methods for C# and on high level API methods.

### Are there any other projects similar to yours? How is our project different?
This project builds upon all API projects performed so far (JavaScript, C++, etc.) and takes them to the next level.
